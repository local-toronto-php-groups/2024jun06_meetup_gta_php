We are thrilled to have Larry Garfield join us, live and remotely.

Larry co-authored the Enums RFC (accepted, PHP 8.1), and the Property Hooks RFC (recently accepted, PHP 8.4) with Ilija Tovilo. 

Ilija is paid by the PHP Foundation (https://thephp.foundation/structure/). Larry is a volunteer, who has contributed countless hours, to making these RFC's happen. Thank you to both!

Larry is going to talk about Property Hooks at our meet-up. Bring your questions! 

We are recording our meet-up, in the hope that publishing it will benefit our fellow PHP devs.
